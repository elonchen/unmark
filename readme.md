### Importing bookmarks

Unmark currently supports importing from Unmark's hosted version, any self-hosted version of Unmark, Readability, Pinboard, Delicious, Pocket and many other services.

## How to contribute to Unmark

Please consider donating. Another major way you can contribute is to report any issues you find with Unmark on Github and being as detailed as possible about the issue you're having.

Another way is to contribute your own code via Pull Requests. Here are some notes on how to do that.

### Forking and Pull Requests

- Fork [the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cdevroe/unmark/) into your own account
- Create your own branch of the trunk branch `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
- Update your code and push those code changes back to your fork's branch `git push origin your-branch-name`
- [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/cdevroe/unmark/pulls) using that branch
- And please accept our _thanks_!

This makes it easy for us to test your code locally and also allows the community to have a discussion around it.

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile our SASS files into CSS and concatenate and compress our JavaScript files for use and a few other small tasks. For any updates to JavaScript or styles you will need to use Grunt too. See the Grunt web site for help.

## History

Unmark was originally created by [Colin Devroe](http://cdevroe.com/). It was a side-project called Nilai (the Indonesian word for "mark") and rebuilt from the ground up in 2013 by Plain, a small software company, which included Jeff Johns, Kyle Ruane, Tim Whitacre, Chris Fehnel, Jakub Jakubiec and Colin Devroe.

Now it is being maintained by Colin, Kyle and the community in their spare time. We still use it every day and we want it to be around forever. Please consider donating or contributing code in order to keep Unmark alive and well.
